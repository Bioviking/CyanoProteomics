# CyanoProteomics
 Project Description  Here we take interest in data from light limitation experiments of Cyanobacteria, carried out in Hudson-lab at KTH/SciLifeLab. Cyanobacteria are of interest for biofuel production as their main source of energy under natural conditions is sunlight, and hence could transfer sunlight into chemical energy.  Here we have collected samples from a bioreactor, under 4 different light conditions. The samples (in triplicates) have subsequently been analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The raw data files from the experiment are available from Vital Vialas.  Your task is to:      Match your data using MaxLFQ or OpenMS     Evaluate which proteins that are significantly correlating with sunlight.      As the different light conditions render different cell size, estimate the cell volume/surface ratio based on the cytosolic/membrane protein concentration ratio across the different light conditions.
